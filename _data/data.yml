  considering cutting-edge technologies and requirements for reliability and fault tolerance.
  Moreover, I have recently delved into the realm of machine learning, with a particular
  emphasis on computer vision. This newfound passion complements my professional background,
  and I am actively looking to apply its potential in both ongoing and future projects.
